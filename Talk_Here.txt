Josh- Just trying to make it easier to communicate in one central spot. I liked your Player class and I made an
      instance of it in the main file, but I'm having trouble finding out how you were planning on tracking which
      players turn it is. I have an int that contains the total player number, but nothing to dedicate individually to 
      every player, did you have a plan or am I not seeing something?
