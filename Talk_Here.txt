Josh- Just trying to make it easier to communicate in one central spot. I liked your Player class and I made an
      instance of it in the main file, but I'm having trouble finding out how you were planning on tracking which
      players turn it is. I have an int that contains the total player number, but nothing to dedicate individually to 
      every player, did you have a plan or am I not seeing something?

Josh- I just made a few revisions on my end, but I can't get the program to run with the player class involved.
      I was recieving something over 80 errors, I think we also need to add the if, else if statements in the player
      class to a method to call on. Any thoughts?

Mark-Sorry, I pushed the Player file out while it was still half baked, I’ll be working of that and pushing that out shortly.
